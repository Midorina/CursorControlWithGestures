# CursorMovementWithGestures
This project lets you use your computer (Windows & Linux both supported) using blinks and head movements. My professor said "let's not meet again" and blocked me when I told him that I no longer have time to put in this project as I've already graduated, have a full time position in a busy company and take care of my family on my own.

You need a camera and a MetaMotionRL sensor to use it. Other package requirements are included in `requirements.txt`. If you're mildly experienced in the language and this field, this will be a great source for you.
