# CursorControlWithGestures

This project lets you use your computer (Windows & Linux both supported) using blinks and head movements. My professor
said "I don't think you'll get far in life... Let's not meet again." and blocked me when I told him that I no longer
have time to put in this project as I've already graduated, have a full time position in a busy company and take care of
my family on my own. So here's the source code with a license that even allows you to patent whatever is here.

You need a camera and a MetaMotionRL sensor to use it. Other package requirements are included in `requirements.txt`.
You can check out `presentation.pdf` to see the purpose, design and some statistics of this project. If
you're mildly experienced in the language and this field, this will be a great source for you.
